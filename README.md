# Dublin-housing
For building the model open and run build_model_and_forecast.py . 
For visualizing data run open and run visualize_data.py . 
For visualizing prediction open and run visualize_prediction.py . 
the model is built in a wrapper class called make_model.py .
The code is meant for prototyping only, so not the cleanest code but will give you an idea of the project .
