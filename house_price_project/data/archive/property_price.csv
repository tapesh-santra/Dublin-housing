"The Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) was re-launched in "
"September 2016. The new RPPI covers all market purchases of houses "
"and apartments by households, both cash and mortgage-funded. The "
"previously produced index (table HPM01 on the CSO Statbank) covered "
"only mortgage-based transactions. The new RPPI is superior to the old "
"one due to the higher volume of transactions in the price model, the "
"improved quality of the data sources and the addition of better "
"quality locational information (Eircodes and CSO Census Small Area "
"Population Statistics).As communicated to users at the launch of the "
"new RPPI, the original mortgage-based index was to be supported for "
"an interim period.The CSO wishes to inform users that the maintenance "
"of the original RPPI on Statbank will cease from August 2019. "
